;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Extensions to `icomplete.el'.
;;
;;  * Better display of candidates, including highlighting them and showing how many there are.
;;  * Shows key bindings for command candidates, optionally including menu bindings.
;;  * Does not bind keys for cycling in `icomplete-mode'.  Defines a separate mode for that, so you
;;    can use Icomplete with or without those key bindings.  (Emacs 24.4+)
;;  * Support for Icicles:
;;    . Respect current Icicles sort order, which you can cycle using `C-,'.
;;    . When you change direction cycling candidates, show the number of other cycle candidates.
;;
;;
;;  Macros defined here (but identical to those in Emacs 23):
;;
;;    `with-local-quit', `with-no-input'.
;;
;;  Commands define here:
;;
;;    `icompletep-cycling-mode'.
;;
;;  Faces defined here:
;;
;;    `icompletep-choices', `icompletep-determined',
;;    `icompletep-keys', `icompletep-nb-candidates'.
;;
;;  User options defined here:
;;
;;    `icompletep-exact-separator',
;;    `icompletep-include-menu-items-flag' (Emacs 23+),
;;    `icompletep-prospects-length' (Emacs < 23),
;;    `icomplete-show-key-bindings'.
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `icomplete-get-keys' (Emacs > 24.2),
;;    `icompletep-completion-all-sorted-completions',
;;    `icompletep-remove-if'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `icomplete.el'
;;              have been REDEFINED OR ADVISED HERE:
;;
;;    `icomplete-get-keys' (Emacs < 24.3) -
;;       1. Respect `icompletep-include-menu-items-flag'.
;;       2. Do not wrap with `<...>'.
;;       3. If string of keys would be too long then shorten it.
;;
;;    `icomplete-completions' -
;;       1. Prepend the total number of candidates.
;;       2. For file-name completion, respect `completion-ignored-extensions'.
;;       3. With Icicles, sort candidates using `icicle-reversible-sort' and show number of
;;          remaining cycle candidates.  You can cycle the sort order using `C-,'.
;;       4. Show candidates in a different face.
;;       5. Optionally show and highlight key bindings, truncating if too long.
;;
;;    `icomplete-exhibit' -
;;       1. Save match-data.
;;       2. Do not insert if input begins with `(' (e.g. `repeat-complex-command').
;;       3. Ensure that the insertion does not deactivate mark.
;;
;;    `icomplete-mode' - Advised to provide Icomplete+ doc.
;;
;;
;;  This file should be loaded after loading the standard GNU file
;;  `icomplete.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:
;;  (eval-after-load "icomplete" '(progn (require 'icomplete+)))
;;
;;  Usage notes:
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 23 you can get icompletion of things like
;;    file names also.  See variable (non-option)
;;    `icomplete-with-completion-tables'.  If you set it to the
;;    (undocumented) value `t' then icompletion is available anytime
;;    the completion COLLECTION parameter is a function, which
;;    includes file-name completion.
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 24 you can specify the kinds of completion
;;    you want by customizing option `completion-category-overrides'
;;    for file names, buffer names, bookmark names, and so on.
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 24.4, Icomplete mode automatically binds
;;    keys that are otherwise useful in the minibuffer (for Isearch,
;;    symbol completion, etc.) to its own keys for cycling among
;;    icompletion candidates.  This is a BAD idea - see Emacs bug
;;    #13602.  Icomplete+ fixes this by having a separate mode that
;;    binds Icomplete keys, making that optional.  This is analogous
;;    to the difference between `cua-selection-mode' and `cua-mode'.
;;
;;    So with Icomplete+, just turning on Icomplete mode does not
;;    co-opt those keys taking them away from you for use in the
;;    minibuffer.  If you really want to do that then turn on
;;    `icomplete-cycling-mode' in addition to `icomplete-mode'.  And
;;    in that case, consider also choosing different keys to bind in
;;    `icomplete-minibuffer-map' from those that are bound by default.
;;
;;  (The first two features above are not particular to Icomplete+ -
;;  they are available also for vanilla Icomplete.)

;;
;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2019/01/14 dadams
;;     Applied fix for Emacs bug #34070.
;; 2016/07/04 dadams
;;     icomplete-exhibit (Emacs 24.4+): Call icomplete--field-(beg|end) only once.
;; 2015/06/18 dadams
;;     icomplete-completions: Use boundp for icicle-mode, not fboundp.
;; 2014/04/15 dadams
;;     icomplete-exhibit: Update version tests, for Emacs 24.4 pretest (23.90.1).
;; 2014/04/13 dadams
;;     icomplete-exhibit, fix Emacs bug #17165: Ensure no error because (icomplete--field-*) is nil.
;; 2014/03/10 dadams
;;     icomplete-exhibit: Reverted fix from 2014-03-05 for Emacs < 23 (broke progressive completion).
;; 2014/03/05 dadams
;;     icomplete-exhibit: Wrap body with with-current-buffer, to prevent using *Completions* buffer.
;; 2014/01/11 dadams
;;     Soft, not hard require cl-lib.el.  Only 24.3+ has it.
;;     icompletep-completion-all-sorted-completions for Emacs 24.1-3:
;;       Use icompletep-remove-if if cl-delete-if is not defined (i.e., for Emacs 24.1-2).
;; 2013/12/31 dadams
;;     icomplete-exhibit, for Emacs 24.3.50: Protect icomplete-show-matches-on-no-input with boundp.
;; 2013/12/27 dadams
;;     icomplete-exhibit, icomplete-completions, icompletep-completion-all-sorted-completions:
;;       Added 24.4+ version.
;;     icompletep-completion-all-sorted-completions:
;;       Use cl-delete-if, not delete-if.  And require cl-lib.el.
;;       Take regexp-opt calculation out of the cl-delete-if loop, for performance.
;; 2013/09/21 dadams
;;     icompletep-completion-all-sorted-completions:
;;       Temporary hack for 24.4: completion--cache-all-sorted-completions takes 3 args now.
;; 2013/01/31 dadams
;;     Added: icompletep-cycling-mode.  Turn it off by default.
;; 2013/01/01 dadams
;;     Added: icompletep-completion-all-sorted-completions.
;;     icomplete-completions (Emacs 24 version):
;;       Rewrote to support Icicles sorting and Emacs 24 candidate metadata:
;;         Use icompletep-completion-all-sorted-completions instead of all-completions or
;;           completion-pcm--filename-try-filter.
;;         Use completion--field-metadata, last, and base-size.
;;         Use completion-try-completion, not try-completion.
;;         Do not sort using string-lessp (sorted by icompletep-completion-all-sorted-completions).
;; 2012/12/19 dadams
;;     icomplete-completions: Use width of icomplete-separator, not 1 or 2.  Use string-width more.
;;     icomplete-separator: Use same default value as vanilla Emacs.
;; 2012/12/08 dadams
;;     icompletep-exact-separator: Different default value - Unicode star for Emacs 23+, * otherwise.
;; 2012/12/05 dadams
;;     Updated wrt Emacs 24:
;;      Added: icomplete-show-key-bindings (removed from vanilla Emacs), icomplete-separator,
;;             icompletep-exact-separator.
;;      icomplete-exhibit: Added completion-all-sorted-completions as delay inhibition.
;;      icomplete-completions (all versions): Use icomplete-separator, icompletep-exact-separator.
;; 2012/11/19 dadams
;;     icomplete-completions:
;;       Exclude file names with extensions in completion-ignored-extensions.
;;       Use same MOST sexp as in Emacs <23 versions, since use try-completion.

;; 2012/06/16 dadams
;;     icomplete-completions (Emacs 23+):
;;       Use actual length of nb-cands-string, not min length from %7d format spec.
;;       Include length of icicle-completion-prompt-overlay, if Icicles and completing.
;; 2012/03/09 dadams
;;     icomplete-completions: Updated for Emacs 24: Bind non-essential and handle bug #10850.
;; 2011/10/13 dadams

;; 2004/04/13 dadams
;;     I'm not sure that some of the "enhancements" here are still
;;     needed.  This code was written long ago.  In particular, I'm not
;;     sure that the changes to `icomplete-exhibit' and the
;;     redefinitions of the Emacs primitives are needed.  Even if they
;;     are not needed, I'm leaving them in, as they are benign :).
;; 1995/12/15 dadams
;;     Defined replacements that reset minibuffer-completion-table to avoid
;;     icompletion: read-string, read-from-minibuffer, read-no-blanks-input.
;; 1995/11/30 dadams
;;     Added redefinition of yes-or-no-p.
;; 1995/10/17 dadams
;;     1) Added icomplete-choices-face and icomplete-determined-face.
;;     2) Redefined icomplete-exhibit: Doesn't insert if input
;;        begins with `('  (e.g. repeat-complex-command).

NAME is the name to complete.
CANDIDATES are the candidates to match.
PREDICATE filters matches: they succeed only if it returns non-nil.
REQUIRE-MATCH non-nil means the input must match a candidate.

The display is updated with each minibuffer keystroke during
minibuffer completion.

Prospective completion suffixes (if any) are displayed, bracketed by
\"()\", \"[]\", or \"{}\".  The choice of brackets is as follows:

  \(...) - A single prospect is identified, and matching is enforced.
  \[...] - A single prospect is identified, and matching is optional.
  \{...} - Multiple prospects are indicated, and further input is
          needed to distinguish a single one.

The displays for unambiguous matches have ` [ Matched ]' appended
\(whether complete or not), or ` \[ No matches ]', if no eligible
matches exist.  Keybindings for uniquely matched commands are
shown within brackets, [] (without the word \"Matched\"), if there is
room.

When more than one completion is available, the total number precedes
the suffixes display, like this:
  M-x forw    14 (ard-) { char line list...}

If library `icicles.el' is also loaded, then you can cycle
completions.  When you change cycling direction, the number of
additional cycle candidates, besides the current one, is displayed

  (defun icomplete-completions (name collection predicate require-match)
    "Identify prospective candidates for minibuffer completion.
NAME is the name to complete.
COLLECTION is the collection of candidates to match.
PREDICATE filters matches: they succeed only if it returns non-nil.
REQUIRE-MATCH non-nil means the input must match a candidate.

The display is updated with each minibuffer keystroke during
minibuffer completion.

Prospective completion suffixes (if any) are displayed, bracketed by
\"()\", \"[]\", or \"{}\".  The choice of brackets is as follows:

  \(...) - A single prospect is identified, and matching is enforced.
  \[...] - A single prospect is identified, and matching is optional.
  \{...} - Multiple prospects are indicated, and further input is
          needed to distinguish a single one.

The displays for unambiguous matches have ` [ Matched ]' appended
\(whether complete or not), or ` \[ No matches ]', if no eligible
matches exist.  Keybindings for uniquely matched commands are
shown within brackets, [] (without the word \"Matched\"), if there is
room.

When more than one completion is available, the total number precedes
the suffixes display, like this:
  M-x forw    14 (ard-) { char line list...}

If library `icicles.el' is also loaded, then you can cycle
completions.  When you change cycling direction, the number of
additional cycle candidates, besides the current one, is displayed
following the rest of the icomplete info:
  M-x forward-line   [Matched]  (13 more)."

  (defun icomplete-completions (name candidates predicate require-match)
    "Identify prospective candidates for minibuffer completion.
NAME is the name to complete.
CANDIDATES is the collection of candidates to match.  See
`completing-read' for its possible values.
PREDICATE filters matches: they succeed only if it returns non-nil.
REQUIRE-MATCH non-nil means the input must match a candidate.

The display is updated with each minibuffer keystroke during
minibuffer completion.

Prospective completion suffixes (if any) are displayed, bracketed by
\"()\", \"[]\", or \"{}\".  The choice of brackets is as follows:

  \(...) - A single prospect is identified, and matching is enforced.
  \[...] - A single prospect is identified, and matching is optional.
  \{...} - Multiple prospects are indicated, and further input is
          needed to distinguish a single one.

The displays for unambiguous matches have ` [ Matched ]' appended
\(whether complete or not), or ` \[ No matches ]', if no eligible
matches exist.  Keybindings for uniquely matched commands are
shown within brackets, [] (without the word \"Matched\"), if there is
room.

When more than one completion is available, the total number precedes
the suffixes display, like this:

  M-x forw    14 (ard-) { char line list...}

In Icicle mode:
 * The current Icicles sort order is used.
 * When cycling candidates and you change direction, the number of
   other cycling candidates is shown, as `(N more)'.  For example:

   M-x forward-line   [Matched]  (13 more)."
